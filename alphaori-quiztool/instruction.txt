***INSTRUCTION TO MANAGE QUIZTOOL APP***

MONGO DATABASE: Before running this app locally, you must download and install MongoDB on your machine. Update the config.js file in the quiz-node folder with the URL to your Mongo server, which will most usually be 'mongodb://localhost:27017.' Make sure to add the database you wish to connect to following the server link; it will be '/quiz' for our purposes. Your final 'mongoUrl' should be something like 'mongodb://localhost:27017/quiz.' If you are connecting to a Mongo instance in the cloud, use that server's URL instead, and be sure to include '/quiz' at the end. That's it! Your database should automatically populate when you interact with the Node server.

LINKING TO THE RIGHT QUIZ: In order to update the quizzes you are offering to users, edit the MainComponent.js file and HomeComponent.js in the quiz-react/src/components folder. In the MainComponent.js file, edit the first parameter of the calls to the fetchQuiz function (lines 85-87). This parameter should be the name of the quiz you want from the database. In the HomeComponent.js file, be sure to rename the quizzes offered, and change the logging information. This app can only support offering a user three quizzes at a time (otherwise, bigger and more fundamental edits are necessary).
